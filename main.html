 	<h1> How a Chinese Cooking Blog is Changing Cooking in America </h1>
 	<h2> Created in 2013, the family-run recipes blog, Woks of Life, has been like the Bible of Chinese home cooking. With a new cookbook and headquarters coming soon, the Leungs are planning for a futrue of chinese cooking in America. </h2>
 	<p class="byline"> By Kat Chow 

	<h3>Sarah and Kaitlin Leung are trying to explain luffa to me.</h3>

	<h3> “Do you like luffa? Chinese luffa, do you eat it?” Kaitlin asks. It’s a sunny afternoon in September, and we’re crouching in their parents’ vegetable garden in New Jersey, near rows of asparagus, squash, tomatoes, and eggplants, the last of which we’ll pick for a meal we’ll cook later. The farm is part of the new headquarters for <a href= https://thewoksoflife.com/chicken-with-sticky-rice> The Woks of Life</a>, their nine-year-old blog that is arguably the internet authority on Chinese home cooking in America. </h3>

	<h3> I have no idea what the Leung sisters are talking about. My mind reels as I try to recall food memories from childhood that might contain the vegetable. Is it in that cold jellyfish and meat dish at Cantonese banquets? (No.) Is it another word for bitter melon? (No.) </h3>

	<h3> “So you know when you scrub yourself with a luffa? Literally, it’s that. But pre-dried. Chinese people will eat it,” Kaitlin says. “It’s in soups, or you’ll see it stir-fried with eggs,” Sarah, the oldest Leung sister, says. “It’s kind of squishy in texture, like really soft.” </h3>

	<h3> “If your parents were here, they’d probably be like, ‘Whoa, yeah! Love it!’” Kaitlin says.</h3>

	<h3> Later, I find out that <a href= https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-ingredients-glossary/asian-vegetables-beans-melons > luffa is also known as si gua,</a> or Chinese okra. I think about how right Kaitlin is—how my father would have been able to identify the vegetable, and how he would have been thrilled to learn how easy it is to grow with enough bright sunlight.</h3>

	<h3> This feeling of recognition—and the progression of it—is reminiscent of what it’s like to read recipes on The Woks of Life, which Kaitlin and Sarah run with their parents, Bill and Judy. Someone brings up a vegetable that seems familiar, if only you could form the word that’s on the tip of your tongue. Maybe your family has a nickname in English for it. And then, the revelation hits like a blast: The Leungs explain exactly what you’ve been grasping for. They share photos and context and recipes. Reading The Woks of Life, you finally understand this piece of your heritage in a way that you’ll hopefully remember and can impart later.</h3>

	<h3> Since 2013, the Leungs have published hundreds of recipes that now receive millions of views every month, and they’ve solidified their reputation as a trusted resource with detailed guides that walk home cooks through the necessary equipment and ingredients to make their dishes. Over the years, they’ve garnered a cult-like following among chefs and Chinese cooking enthusiasts alike. The chef J. Kenji López-Alt says the Leungs’ recipes, both inspirational and functional, have helped him bring his own family around the dinner table. “The Leungs are as real as it gets,” he says. The cookbook author and restaurateur Molly Yeh writes in an email that the Leungs’ “knowledge of Chinese cooking is encyclopedic.” Friends tell me they and their relatives consult the blog all the time, which I can relate to—The Woks of Life is about the only site my entire family consults, including my father, who notoriously shirks recipes. </h3>

	<h3> The Leungs have taken note of this loyal audience and bet big on The Woks of Life, entwining their lives with it. In the last year, Bill and Judy purchased this sprawling farm with plans to use the property’s historic barn to build a kitchen studio for filming recipes, and Sarah now works full-time on the blog. The payoffs of this type of effort are clear: They were recently featured in <a href =https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/family-meal> Family Meal</a>, a digital miniseries produced by the Food Network, and now, with their debut cookbook, The Woks of Life, out this month, the Leungs—along with their charisma and approachability—are poised to reach even more people. The more time I spend with the family, the clearer it becomes that they’re on the precipice of something huge.</h3>

	<h3> At the Leungs’ doorstep, I slip off my shoes and Judy hands me a pair of oversized slippers. As I shuffle inside, so begins a whirlwind of offerings: water, coffee, tea, soup, a mooncake that they’d made a couple weeks before for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Outside one of the kitchen windows, Bill strides across the paddock to tend to a motley crew of alpacas and goats (and one llama), as well as ducks and chickens, whose eggs they use in their cooking. Looking around their kitchen with its two islands and an enviable range meant for cooking with a commercial-size wok, I could see why a family documenting the details of their lives to millions would make a home here. It is a perfectly—overwhelmingly—idyllic backdrop for a cooking blog.</h3>

	<h3> Nearly a decade earlier, long before the Leungs had to consider how to share their life and recipes with readers, they were simply trying to figure out how to navigate life’s various stages. In 2012, when Sarah graduated with a degree in media studies from Vassar College in upstate New York, job prospects were slim. Kaitlin was still attending the University of Pennsylvania, and Bill and Judy had relocated from New Jersey to Beijing for Bill’s job at Nokia, where he’d been tasked with creating a new software engineering team. After spending a year working abroad and then coming back home alone, Sarah, facing the distance from her parents, started posting recipes to The Woks of Life. In many ways, that humble blog became a solution to different problems.</h3>

	<h3> “I was feeling like I didn’t have a lot of direction,” Sarah recalls. “I felt like the blog connected me to [my family] because they were far away—and also, I was tired of my own food that I was able to cook myself.” The Leung parents raised their children with food as a constant presence: the British cooking program Two Fat Ladies often played on their TV, and with Bill and Judy’s backgrounds at a relative’s restaurant, the daughters developed discerning tastes. Sarah often requested the family’s simple version of a <a href = https://thewoksoflife.com/chicken-with-sticky-rice >roasted chicken stuffed with sticky rice</a>, which requires deboning chicken thighs and wrapping them around sticky rice cooked with shiitake mushrooms, shallots, and thick chunks of lap cheong.</h3>

	<h3> When they first started The Woks of Life, Sarah and Kaitlin were cooking what they call Food Network stuff—recipes by Giada De Laurentiis and Ina Garten. (“Still delicious,” Kaitlin insists. “Still good,” Sarah agrees. “But not the food of childhood.”) Their repertoire for Chinese food was limited to assembling a cold tofu dish or frying noodles in a pan and tossing them with a splash of soy sauce.</h3>

	<h3> Early posts in The Woks of Life detail the Leungs’ everyday activities. Sarah wrote about her life in that way that kids who grew up in the mid-aughts on Xanga or BlogSpot are familiar with: She <a href =https://thewoksoflife.com/the-woks-of-life-home-and-garden-not-pretty>weeded at her parents’ house</a>; she explored Beijing when she eventually moved there to live with her parents and work in digital marketing. Her family would respond in the comments, and reading these old entries, I feel almost voyeuristic, like I’m eavesdropping into the intimate, mundane details of their lives. (Bill, in peak dad form, responding to the weeding post: “Sarah, make short work of it with the weed whacker! Maybe bake some cookies and bribe Boris and his landscaping crew!”)</h3>

	<h3> Sarah and the rest of her family persisted, posting a regular slew of recipes based on Judy and Bill’s know-how: a <a href = https://thewoksoflife.com/cantonese-style-scallion-ginger-crab> Cantonese preparation</a> of stir-fried crab with scallions and ginger, blanched gai lan with oyster sauce, cold tofu salad with julienned hot peppers and carrots. Judy grew up in Hubei and Shanghai and is the only family member born in China. Her ability to speak three dialects of Chinese—Shanghainese, Cantonese, and Mandarin—allows her to scour Chinese-language cookbooks or watch YouTube recipe videos in Chinese for inspiration. The sisters describe their mother as having a deep reserve of personal and traditional recipes, including <a href =https://thewoksoflife.com/shanghai-wonton-soup >wonton soup</a> found in street stalls in Shanghai and her aunt’s version of “Old Shanghai” potato salad, a recipe that’s currently only in the cookbook.</h3>

	<h3> Bill grew up in the borscht belt of the Catskills, in Liberty, New York, and worked at his family’s Chinese restaurant. On the blog, he is the family’s expert in American Chinese take-out dishes, such as <a href =https://thewoksoflife.com/chicken-chop-suey> chicken chop suey</a>, and Cantonese cuisine, including the <a href =https://thewoksoflife.com/cantonese-steamed-fish> iconic steamed fish</a> with ginger and scallions. He’s worked as a software engineer and has experience in construction, and with his unplaceable New York–New Jersey accent, seems like the type of guy who knows a little about most things. Or in many cases, a lot about most things. “I’m gonna tell you the real story, Kat,” he says conspiratorially at one point in our conversation. In a “fanatic” fervor, he created the <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-ingredients-glossary> blog’s ingredients glossary</a>, cementing his role as its expert in technical cooking skills. In his enthusiasm, he didn’t pause to copyedit the glossary and, he shares with a self-deprecating laugh, “for three, four years, we actually got comments like, ‘We can’t believe your grammar and spelling is so bad.’” </h3>

	<h3> The Leungs continued cultivating a unique identity, scoring a <a href =https://www.saveur.com/blog-awards-2015-winners> Saveur Blog Award in 2015</a>. Around Lunar New Year of 2016, they noticed a spike in traffic—ostensibly from people searching for what to cook for the new year—with more than a million page views per month for the first time. These days, the blog receives 7 million monthly page views, and the Leungs churn out a smoothly produced newsletter rounding up their dumpling recipes, their most-used cooking resources, and <a href =https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-grow-chinese-garlic-chives/?utm_source=The+Woks+Of+Life+Subscriber+List&utm_campaign=c660a36ced-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_102822_GrowGarlicChives&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_02de1ed282-c660a36ced-154944823>how to grow and use garlic chives.</a> </h3>

	<h3> The sisters credit the multigenerational aspect for their success. “Something I make, they have input in it. They’re like, ‘Mmm, this is good, it’s a good start, but maybe try this,’” Sarah says. Having four different perspectives on every recipe demands high quality. Judy is the type of precise woman, for instance, who takes joy in every meal. “A little bit of effort, and you can eat so much better,” she insists. Don’t take shortcuts. “You really shouldn’t do that, because your meals are limited.” </h3>

	<h3> Recipe testing is not complete until the family can agree as a whole that the dish is done. “It’s a team,” Sarah says. “And that team happens to be your family, and everybody really cares—like really, really cares—and is very picky.”</h3>

	<h3> The Leungs and I talk about how sometimes, passing down stories and knowledge can feel like a game of assimilationist telephone. That very specific legend that so many Chinese kids grew up hearing, about why we eat <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/zongzi-recipes> zongzi</a>, the sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaves? The one with the poet who drowned in the river? When tasked with relaying that story, you try not to butcher the details too much. You try to leave the tale intact so that it bears some semblance to what your grandparents told your parents, who in turn told you. The Leungs grew into experts in distilling this type of information in a simple and self-aware voice: “The story is grim, yes, but that’s how it goes!” writes Judy in their <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/zongzi-cantonese-style> Cantonese-style zongzi recipe</a>. This is in large part because, for the first few years of the blog, they mostly published recipes to a small audience of their own family. In figuring out how to speak to one another, they crafted a voice that appeals to various generations.</h3>

	<h3> Loyal fans—some of whom are of Chinese descent and many of whom are not—are drawn to the recipes because of their straightforward and detailed descriptions. Michelle King, a historian and an associate professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who cooks The Woks of Life recipes frequently with her children, appreciates the blog’s close guidance. “You can kind of immediately see, ‘What is this technique?’” </h3>

	<h3> The Woks of Life’s collection of recipes for zongzi, for instance, breaks down how to make the notoriously time-intensive dish, which many families (mine, at least) would prefer to buy instead of making themselves. On the blog, Judy details how to soak, snip, and shape bamboo leaves. “You must use <a href= https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-cooking-tools/#kitchen-shears> kitchen shears</a> to cut away at least half an inch off the bottom of every leaf” to prevent the leaf stem puncturing while wrapping, Judy writes in the post, which is accompanied by a whopping 21 photos that demonstrate how to wind the leaves around sticky rice stuffed with boiled peanuts, hunks of salted duck egg yolks, and fatty pieces of pork belly and lap cheong.</h3>

	<h3> Kevin Lo, a Cantonese reader who first came across The Woks of Life in the summer of 2018, says he was looking up zongzi recipes in honor of his late grandfather, who insisted the Shanghainese version of zongzi was the best. “The Woks of Life was the first place I saw that addressed the difference between Cantonese and <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/sticky-rice-dumpling-shanghai-pork-zongzi> Shanghainese zongzi</a> (dark soy sauce, for instance),” Lo writes in an email. “I was hooked.”</h3>

	<h3> When it comes to Chinese home cooking in America, the culinary lineage is scant. King’s scholarly work focuses on Chinese cuisine and cookbooks, including the English-language recipes by the Taiwanese icon Fu Pei-mei, whose volumes of <a href =https://sf.eater.com/2020/11/17/21570459/radical-family-farms-fu-pei-mei-chinese-cookbook-taiwan-cook-off> Chinese Cook Book</a> my father considers the Bible of Chinese cooking. Fu Pei-mei’s recipes are sparse with details, which can make following them difficult, King says, though Fu had her own TV program that made her work more accessible. The Woks of Life’s approach—recipes accompanied by the occasional video, such as their take on <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/beef-with-broccoli-all-purpose-stir-fry-sauce> beef with broccoli</a>—mirrors this multi-platform method. (King’s comparison between Fu Pei-mei and the Leungs’ recipes is not lost on me; a friend and I often refer to The Woks of Life’s blog as “the Bible.”)</h3>

	<h3> King also has a copy of the chef and restaurateur <a href=https://openvault.wgbh.org/exhibits/art_of_asian_cooking/article> Joyce Chen’s</a> cookbook from 1962, simply named <a href=https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-labs-reading-list-joyce-chen-cook-book> Joyce Chen Cookbook</a>.Starting in 1966, Chen hosted a television show on Boston’s PBS station, which producers hoped would follow in the footsteps of <a href = https://openvault.wgbh.org/exhibits/art_of_asian_cooking/article>Julia Child’s The French Chef</a>, introducing American households to Chinese cuisine. Chen’s program lasted only 26 episodes, but she fashioned a career out of making Chinese cuisine accessible to non-Chinese cooks, which included creating a <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/05/18/joyce-chen> flat-bottomed wok</a> that is still popular today.</h3>

	<h3> But Chen basically envisioned “white mainstream women” as her viewers, according to King. The Woks of Life, on the other hand, “[speaks] to Asian American audiences or even Chinese American audiences,” she says. In an episode demonstrating how to cook beef with vegetables, Chen cheerfully shows viewers the difference between the thinner Chinese peapods and the raised peapods that people could more easily find, inviting substitutions. In contrast, more than half a century later, the Leungs’ beef with broccoli video can confidently insist that viewers and readers adhere to a certain baseline of ingredients, given their countless guides that help readers understand what something is and where to find it. Watching the two episodes alongside each another, there’s a sweetness in seeing how far Chinese home cooking in America has come—and how chefs like Chen have made a path for families like the Leungs.</h3>

	<h3> The Woks of Life’s hard-earned accessibility resonates for people like Mike Yu, who has read the blog since 2017 or so, when his sister sent him a recipe for <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/red-cooked-pork-hong-shao-rou-grandmas-version> hong shao rou</a>. Yu’s parents grew up in Lanzhou and came to the US for graduate school and eventually raised their kids in New Jersey.</h3>

	<h3> “Every time I read one, I have the feeling of someone sitting down and saying ‘You grew up eating this, here’s how you make it,’” Yu says. He takes screenshots of the glossary of ingredients and refers to them when he’s at the store. “These recipes don’t compromise their ingredients for things that are easier to get from a Whole Foods,” he says.</h3>

	<h3> When I ask the Leungs who they write The Woks of Life for, they erupt into conversation: </h3>

	<h3> “When we started, it was like two ABCs, who were like, ‘Okay, we know what it should taste like, but we need help with how to get there,’” Kaitlin says, using the acronym for American-born Chinese. “It was almost like we envisioned that we were talking to people who were more like us.”</h3>

	<h3> “But then once that audience came in, who didn’t know, it was like, ‘Okay, we’re going to give more explanation, but we don’t necessarily want it to seem scary,’” or complicated to make, Sarah pipes up.</h3>

	<h3> The family is on a roll at this point, invigorated by trying to explain their vision.</h3>

	<h3> When writing an introduction to a recipe, “we don’t think about, so much, as to who’s on the receiving end,” Judy says. “But it’s like: If you find it fascinating, you read it.”</h3>

	<h3> “You can skip to the recipe,” Bill quips.</h3>

	<h3> “Exactly, so it’s more our way of expressing ourselves,” Judy says.</h3>

	<h3> They’re constantly finishing each other’s sentences and gently correcting or adding to what someone else has said, an experience that’s akin to editing in real time.</h3>

	<h3> When it’s time to cook our meal, the Leungs move to their kitchen stations without speaking, Kaitlin mincing ginger and garlic, Judy peeling hard-boiled eggs, and Sarah julienning carrots and potatoes. We’re preparing stir-fried eggplant with garlic sauce, braised pork belly with eggs, and a spicy potato and carrot salad, all from their cookbook, along with a side of Chinese greens. Bill teaches me to slice the eggplant we picked earlier in the day, correcting the way I hold the knife. Throughout this, we joke that the Leungs are “hazing” me by putting me to work, and I marvel at how easily they’ve folded me into their family’s meal. It occurs to me later that this might be because they’ve spent years considering how to make their cooking welcoming to readers. And they’ve done it together, thousands of hours logged in the kitchen, bumping into one another until the rough edges of usual family dynamics have softened and worn down, until cooking this way—being this way, making things together this way—became second nature.</h3>

	<h3> We sit on the patio for an early dinner, and the afternoon sun is gentle as we pass the dishes around the table, quiet for the first time in hours, our chopsticks clinking against our bowls of rice. A few hundred feet away, the chickens squawk in their pen. Earlier in the day, one of the Leungs had gathered some of their eggs for this meal. I break apart one of the ochre-colored eggs that Judy had boiled in a thick rock sugar and soy sauce glaze, a rich pairing with the braised pork. The eggplant that we’ve seared and caramelized with a garlic sauce is similar to the <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-eggplant-garlic-sauce/#recipe> first recipe by The Woks of Life</a> that I can recall cooking years ago; however, this cookbook version makes minor tweaks, like swapping out doubanjiang for oyster sauce and using cornstarch to thicken the sauce.</h3>

	<h3> While we eat, the family simmers with excitement as they describe The Woks of Life’s future—how the many possibilities can sustain them for years to come. For the next iteration of their blog, they’ll build a kitchen studio in the barn looming behind us. This dedicated space will allow them to test more recipes and film more videos.</h3>

	<h3> “We have people ask us, ‘Oh, are you going to run out of ideas soon?’” Judy says. “There’s absolutely no way you’re ever going to run out of what to cook.” For example, the blog went into depth with Cantonese and Shanghainese food and “scratched the surface” of Sichuan and Hunan cuisine. The Leungs want to deepen their knowledge of other regions in China, including the cuisine of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xinjiang.</h3>

	<h3> Sarah had mentioned earlier in the day that when she’s not recipe testing or working on the blog, her husband often cooks for the two of them. He didn’t grow up in a Chinese household, and it’s convenient that he can select a recipe from their blog—like <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/beef-with-bitter-melon> beef with bitter melon</a>—and make her family’s food without her having to teach him. The blog’s tagline sas they’re a “culinary genealogy,” but it strikes me for the first time how practical a record of family recipes might be.</h3>

	<h3> The Woks of Life recipes are for readers, sure, but “a lot of these posts are for us,” too, Bill says. “When I’m 92 and a half years old and I read back the recipes and stories, I want to be able to look at lots of photos and lots of things and just remember all of the family history.”</h3>

	<h3> It’s a history that is, in turn, shaping the culinary genealogy of so many other families, especially Chinese home cooks, around the world.</h3>
